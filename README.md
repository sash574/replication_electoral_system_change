# Replication: Proportional Representation and Right-Wing Populism

This is a replication of the main body of the following paper, coded in Python using the pysyncon module:

Becher M, Menéndez González I, Stegmueller D. Proportional Representation and Right-Wing Populism: Evidence from Electoral System Change in Europe. British Journal of Political Science. 2023;53(1):261-268. doi:10.1017/S0007123421000703

It also includes several robustness checks of which some are part of the appendix of the paper.

The data, a replication file in R and further supplementary materials of the paper are publicly and openly available via the link below and therefore included in this repository.

The paper itself is not open access which is why I have not included it in this repository.
